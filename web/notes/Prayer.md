## Prayer was an essential part of Jesus' life

- Luke 11 - Passage on prayer

-

- Throughout the Gospel of Luke, Jesus prayer life is highlighted. The mount of olives is where he went to pray. The garden of Gethsemene lies on the mount of olives.

- Luke 22:39  Then, accompanied by the disciples, Jesus left the upstairs room and went as usual to the Mount of Olives. 40 There he told them, “Pray that you will not give in to temptation.”

- Luke 21:37 tells us that Jesus taught in the temple during the day and spent the night in the mount of olives

- What does olive signify?
    - Peace (dove returning to noah,)
    - Prosperity and Blessing (promise land)
    - Endurance and faithfulness (endurance faithfulness and deep rooted relationship with God)
    - Holiness, Anointing and Presence of God (Olive oil was used to anoint priests and kings in the OT. The tabernacles lampstand had olive oil to keep it burning)

- ## What does Gethsemene mean? -> oil press or oil extraction. It was the pinnacle of Jesus prayer life where he sweat blood.

Luke 9: 18 - Jesus left the crowds alone to Pray.

**Luke 6:12-13 (NIV):**  
**12** One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.  
**13** When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles.

What was the prayer Jesus taught us?

Simplicity

Matures us

Mat_21:22  And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.”

Jas 1:5  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. 
Jas 1:6  But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 

Jas_5:16  Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.

Jas_5:17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. 

Joh 15:7  If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 

### How do we have faith in God?

- Trust God, God knows
