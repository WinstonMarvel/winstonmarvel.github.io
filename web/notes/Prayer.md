Mat_21:22  And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.”


Jas 1:5  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. 
Jas 1:6  But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 


Jas_5:16  Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.

Jas_5:17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. 


Joh 15:7  If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 



### How do we have faith in God?

- Trust God, God knows
