# Discouragement

Mat_21:22  And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.”

Jas 1:5  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. 
Jas 1:6  But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 

Jas_5:16  Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.

Jas_5:17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. 

Joh 15:7  If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 

### Casting your cares

1 Pet 5:7 casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully].



### One day at a time

Matt 6:34 NIV Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

Trust God for each day. What does this mean?

- God let someone talk to me 

- Give me something joyful to look forward to at work today

- I want to laugh at something just today



### Come unto my all who are weary

The Holy Spirit of God refreshes us. All our discouragement will turn into Joy. The fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace.

- If you are weary trust Jesus - He gives you rest

- He gives you living waters John 4 (Woman at the well)





### Summary

When you are overwhelmed by love. When you know that God cares for you so much more than you care for yourself. He cares about what you eat, what you think, how you feel, etc much more than you yourself do. Not one hair of your head falls to the ground without him knowing (Matt 6). So let his love change you.
