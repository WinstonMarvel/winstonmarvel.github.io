### Who is he?

- He is the spirit of the Father Matt 10:20 - compare with parallel in Luke where it says Holy Spirit and not Spirit of the Father
- He's a gift - Receive the gift of the Holy Spirit Acts 2:38
- Helper
- Comforter (Acts 9:31)
- Dwells with us and will be in us (2 fold manifestation) but he also comes upon us (3 fold manifestation)

### What he does

- overshadows (mary, preist at the temple)

- reveals truth

- gives children (Mary, Elizabeth)

- rests on us like a dove

- leads us (Luke 4 wilderness)

- Teaches us what to say (Luke 12)

- Spirit gives life but flesh profiteth nothing

- Multiplies peace to us because through comfort (Acts 9:31)

- Spirit speaks words (Phillip and the eunuch, Acts 11:12, Acts 13:12)

### What he can do/we can do

- cast out demons

- Possible to rejoice in the Spirit - Jesus rejoinced in the Holy Spirit (Luke 10:21)

- Out of our hearts will flow rivers of living water - John 7:38, john 5

- Jesus gives the Spirit without measure John 3:34

- he will teach you all things John 14:26

- Guid you into all the trruth John 16:13

- Shakes the place (And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness. - Acts 4:31)

- Spirit can be resisted (Acts 7:51)

- Spirit is given on the laying of hands (Simon magician saw this - Acts 8:18)

- He can carry us away (Acts 8:39 - Phillip and the eunuch)

- Reveals and explains visions/dreams to us as we ponder about them (Peter and Cornelius - Acts 10:19)

- Falls on those who hear the Word (Acts 10:44)

- Acts 11:28 - Prophesied or actually foretold of world events (famine) -> Reason was to send relief to others

- It is the Holy Spirit who makes us overseers of flock (to care for the chruch) not man - Acts 20:28

- Holy spirit speaks through the Word. Paul said about prophet Isiah (Acts 23:9) that hearing they will indeed never understand

### In the Spirit

- Zechariah entered the temple in the Spirit Luke 2:27

- Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee (after desert) Luke 4:14

### Spirit within

- Filled with the Spirit and began speaking in tongues

- The filling of the spirit is measurable? Full of the Spirit and wisdom - See Acts 6:3, 6:5 (Eg. , pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty. Acts 6:3 )

### Spirit upon

- But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.” - Acts 1:8
- Spirit of the Lord was upon him because was anointed to .... Luke 4:18

What our spirit can do

- Provoke us (Paul was provoked by the idols Acts 17:16)

### Notes

- In the Spirit is something dfferent because Zechariah went in the Spirit into the temple and Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit. so did Simeon enter the temple in the Spirit

- Infilling of the Holy Spirit is not exactly only NT because Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit in Luke 1:41, so was Zechariah and he prophesied Luke 1:67

- Holy Sprit coming upon someone was not either because of Luke 2:25 and neither was the revelation by Holy Spirit

- Spirit of God guides and teaches/instructs. He rarely tells us what to do. A guide is like a ruler, you use it to asses guidelines get direction. He is not controlling

### To ponder

- And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. Acts 18:25

Holy spirit infilling and coming upon people is different

##### Baptism

Act_19:2  And he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they said, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
Act_19:6  And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.

Act_19:21  Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”

Act_20:22  And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,
Act_20:23  except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.

- Act_21:4  And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. - What do you mean through the Spirit?

## How the Holy Spirit leads us

- He leads us through his Word (His word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path). If it contradicts God's word then it's not from him.

- He gives us Spiritual wisdom not as the world (Very importantly not "divided thoughts" which is wordly wisdom)
    - Christ is our wisdom. He is the wisdom of God. His spirit rests on us.
    - Pro_24:3  By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;
    - Isa_11:2  And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
        - But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. James 1:5

- He does not lead us through the thought realm
    - We walk by faith not by sight
    - Notice in Luke 12 that Jesus says that take no thought (KJV) or be anxious(other translations). The root of the word merismos is G3307 which means to be cut into pieces / divided. It is the same word used when Jesus says how can a divided Kingdom stand or divided the land for the brother.
      He leads us through the clarity of thought and conviction. In the thought realm, there is no unity but always division. But in the realm of faith working through love (Gal 5:6) there is a conviction of things hoped for and seen in the Word.

- The Spirit itself bears witness with our Spirit crying Abba Father
    - The spirit of man *is* the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. (inward parts of the belly is often used as the "seat of thought" in Strongs)

- He manifests himself to us when we walk in Love and trust him
    - In worship, when his presence is strong. What is hesaying

- Col 2:23 - Wisdom stops the flesh? what stops it
    - Thinking things above (Col 3: 1-5)
        - Seeking Kingdom culture where things are at the right hand of God the father
        - Seeking things where Christ is. Look at your problems from being raised with Christ, seated at the right hand and exercise authority down onto your problem
        - Realising we are dead and my life is securely hidden in Christ
        - Being aware that we will succeed anyway because our lives arte hidden in God
