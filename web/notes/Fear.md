- Psalm 121
- Jude 1:
- 1 Peter 1:23 for you have been born again [that is, reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose] not of seed which is perishable but [from that which is] imperishable and immortal, that is, through the living and everlasting word of God.

### Casting your cares

1 Pet 5:7 casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully].

### One day at a time

Matt 6:34 NIV Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

Trust God for each day. What does this mean?

- God let someone talk to me 
- Give me something joyful to look forward to at work today
- I want to laugh at something just today

### Come unto my all who are weary

The Holy Spirit of God refreshes us. All our discouragement will turn into Joy. The fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace.

- If you are weary trust Jesus - He gives you rest
- He gives you living waters John 4 (Woman at the well)

#### Suffering (The flesh suffers when you are going the Spirit's direction)

- Phillipians 1:29


We are being conformed to the image of his son day by day

- Rom 8:29 => We are predesitend to be conformed to be like Jesus. As he is so are we day by day
- 2 Cor 3:17

### Summary

When you are overwhelmed by love. When you know that God cares for you so much more than you care for yourself. He cares about what you eat, what you think, how you feel, etc much more than you yourself do. Not one hair of your head falls to the ground without him knowing (Matt 6). So let his love change you.
