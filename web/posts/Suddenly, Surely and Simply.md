When we seek to understand God, we look to Jesus. Jesus, the Word made flesh who dwelt among us, perfectly represents God the Father. The Bible paints a beautiful picture of God through Jesus.

So, who is this God the Father? Allow me to highlight three aspects that deeply resonate with me today.

## God of the Suddenly

In the Bible, we encounter a pool called Bethesda, meaning "house of mercy" in Hebrew. This pool held a special significance because an angel would stir up the water at a certain time. The first person to step in would be healed of their diseases. However, for 38 years, there was a man—whose name is never mentioned—waiting by the pool, hoping for healing. Despite the years of disappointment, he held on to hope. Then, one day, Jesus arrived.

> Jesus said to him, “Rise, take up your bed and walk.” And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked. - **John 5:8 NKJV**

This reveals that Jesus is a God of the suddenly. He isn't finished with us yet. Though life may seem mundane or hopeless, a moment of sudden transformation is on the horizon. God will meet us in our deepest need.

## God of the Surely

In the book of Daniel, we encounter Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who refuse to bow to the king's idols. Despite facing a fiery furnace, they stand firm in their faith, trusting in Yahweh's deliverance. They declare that even if God chooses not to rescue them, they will remain faithful. And indeed, God delivers them from the flames.

Our God is a God of the surely. He will save you. Even if it seems delayed, God's timing is always perfect, often leading to a more spectacular deliverance.

## God who Responds to Simple Cries

The Scriptures assure us that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. As Jesus walked among the people, we witness individuals crying out to Him for mercy. These simple prayers, amidst chaos and noise, moved the heart of God. Jesus was often moved with compassion by such earnest cries. A sincere plea like "Heal me, O Lord" or "Save me, Jesus" is enough to rescue you from life's snares.

I encourage you to echo the words of David:

> I prayed to the LORD, and he answered me. He freed me from all my fears. - **Psalm 34:4 NLT**

A genuine cry from the heart will never go unheard by our loving Father.
