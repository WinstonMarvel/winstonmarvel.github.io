## The Holy Spirit is like a float

- The floats in a pool of water can never stay under forever. Of course, they can be forced down. Force them down completely, they will be submerged as there is pressure, but they are bound to rise above the water.

- I have a word for you today. The Holy Spirit can be likened to that float around your waistline. Our lives are not our own. Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. We may be submerged by the powers of darkness today but we will break free no matter what. It's our nature. We cannot die. We are eternal 'zoe' beings.

> Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? - **1 Corinthians 3:16 ESV**


## So then why are we in pain sometimes?

- Deception and a loss of hope to succeed. When we are faced by clouds of darkness that seem to overwhelm us, it is most often because of deception. There are times in our lives when we don't feel like reading our Bibles or even fighting. Maybe you're stuck in sin or maybe you're so depressed and you just can't seem to fight any longer. All hope seems to be lost. But hey, your float is only submerged ;) It's gonna rise soon!

- You may ask why we haven't risen above our situations yet. But the answer is because a lie has become a stronghold somewhere in our lives. We do not always know what the lie is. But have you noticed that all of a sudden God brings a word, a sermon through his servants, or a song that completely breathes hope and fills you with joy and strength to fight? Do you ever wonder why that happens? The circumstances are usually the same. The difference is "**revelation**" (the greater truth just broke the power of the lie that held you back). Truth set you free. Light prevailed over darkness.

- The Bible tells us that whom the son sets free is free indeed. 

> and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. - **John 8:32 ESV**


## So picture yourself like this boy!

You are this little boy with the float on. You may be under the water now, but you will rise! The Holy Spirit will cause you to succeed always. Just hold on.

> The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again. But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked. - **Proverbs 24:16 NLT**
