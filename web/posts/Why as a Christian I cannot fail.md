Do you remember when you first learned to swim? If you're like me, you probably had a float fixed around your body. As long as this magical float was around your waist, you could never stay underwater forever. Of course, someone could have pushed your body into the water, but you would eventually rise. By the laws of physics, you could force a float down completely, but it would remain submerged as long as there is pressure. You could say they are destined to rise above the water.

## The Holy Spirit is like a float

I would like to share a word with you today: The Holy Spirit is like this magical float around your waistline. Our lives are not our own. Scripture tells us that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit. You and I may be submerged under the water today due to the circumstances of life, but we will rise above, no matter what. This is our new nature. We cannot die. We are eternal 'zoe' beings.

> Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? - **1 Corinthians 3:16 ESV**

## Why do we still live in pain?

Deception is one of the key strategies that the enemy uses against us. We are so deceived that we cannot see hope, and we cannot see success. It can be quite painful when we are faced with clouds of darkness that seem to overwhelm and overpower us. These are those times in our lives when we don't feel like reading our Bibles or even fighting anymore. Maybe you're so depressed and you just can't seem to fight any longer, or maybe you are stuck in the sin-guilt-shame cycle. All hope seems lost. But hey, your float is only submerged ;) It's gonna rise soon!

You may ask why we haven't risen above our situations yet. But the answer is that a lie has become a stronghold somewhere in our lives. We do not always know what the lie is. But have you noticed that all of a sudden God brings a word, a sermon through his servants, or a song that completely breathes hope and fills you with joy and strength to fight? Do you ever wonder why that happens? The circumstances are usually the same. The difference is a "**revelation**" (the greater truth that shattered the power of the lie that held you back). God's Truth set you free as light prevails over darkness. The Bible tells us that whom the son sets free is free indeed.

> and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. - **John 8:32 ESV**

## Picture yourself like this boy!

Stay encouraged. You are like this little boy with the float on. You may be under the water now, but you will rise! The Holy Spirit will cause you to succeed every time. Just hold on, friend! Just hold on.

> The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again. But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked. - **Proverbs 24:16 NLT**
