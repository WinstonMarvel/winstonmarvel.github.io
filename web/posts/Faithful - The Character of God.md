Faithfulness is a defining attribute of God. His unwavering commitment to His promises surpasses our comprehension. Even in our moments of unfaithfulness, He remains steadfast, for faithfulness is inherent to His being.

### God's Character as revealed in the Exodus

In one of the earliest revelations of God's character to His people, we witness the foundational importance of faithfulness. Exodus 34:6 portrays God introducing Himself as the Lord abounding in faithfulness.

> The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, - **Exodus 34:6 ESV**

### Emet - His character

The Hebrew word translated as "faithfulness" originates from 'Emet,' signifying trustworthiness or truth. God embodies Emet - He is truth and trustworthiness personified. Emet denotes stability and reliability, encouraging us to put our trust in God.

Exodus 17 paints an interesting picture of God's faithful character. During Israel's battle with the Amalekites, as long as Moses held his hands up, the Israelites won. But when he dropped his hands, they began to lose. So Aaron and Hur put a rock under Moses' hands so they remained upheld. Moses' steady hands are described using a form of this word "emet". This term is frequently employed throughout Scripture to denote trustworthiness. It's a picture of God, who is as steady and trustworthy as a rock. For instance, in Exodus 18:21, leaders appointed by Moses were to be people of "emet," trustworthy and incorruptible. Other verses include Psalm 31:5, which identifies God as "El Emet," the God of faithfulness.

> “The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and just is He. - **Deuteronomy 32:4 NASB**

### He'emin - Our response to His faithfulness

Secondly, the Hebrew word for trust, "He’emin", derived from Emet, goes beyond 'to believe' or 'to have faith'. While we understand it as trust, its core meaning is rather to consider someone as trustworthy. For example, when the Bible says Abraham "he'emin'd" God, the Bible is telling us that Abraham regarded God as trustworthy.

- Exodus 14:31 depicts Israel "he'emin'ing" God to leave Egypt.
- In 1 Kings 3:6, David walked in "Emet" before God.
- God's promise of a King in 2 Samuel 7:16 is fulfilled in Jesus, the Son of David and Abraham, demonstrating the lineage of those who "he'emin" God.
- Romans 15:8-9 underscores Christ's advent on behalf of God's faithfulness.

Faithfulness emanates from God's unshakable trustworthiness. Our call as believers is to regard God as trustworthy.

Scripture reveals to us that He is truth and cannot act contrary to His nature (2 Timothy 2:13). His words are unfailing; in fact, His plans are unstoppable (Job 42:2). So, when God speaks, it is accomplished. Given His omnipotence and reliability, we should not put our faith and trust in his character - that he is absolutely faithful and trustworthy.

> If we are faithless, he remains faithful— for he cannot deny himself. - **2 Timothy 2:13 ESV**

### Verses to reflect upon

- Deuteronomy 7:9 assures us of God's faithfulness to His covenant and steadfast love.

> Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments. - **Deuteronomy 7:9 NIV**

- Exodus 20:6 emphasizes His steadfast love for thousands who obey Him.

> but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. - **Exodus 20:6 ESV**

- Numbers 23:19 reaffirms God's immutability; He fulfills His promises without fail.

> God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it? - **Numbers 23:19 ESV**

- Psalm 31:3 and 31:5 proclaim His faithfulness and guidance. Notic verse 5 where His name is declared El Emet (God of faithfulness/truth).

> For you are my rock and my fortress; and for your name's sake you lead me and guide me; - **Psalms 31:3 ESV**

> Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.  - **Psalms 31:5 ESV**
