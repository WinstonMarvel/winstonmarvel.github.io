Faithfulness is the character of God. God's faithfulness to his promises go beyond our wildest imaginations. Even when we are unfaithful, he is still ever faithful because that is who He always is.

### God's character defined in Exodus

One of the earliest introductions of God's character to his people show us that faithfulness is a core characteristic of who he is. Exodus 34:6 tells us that God introduces himself as the Lord who abounds in faithfulness. 

> The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, - **Exodus 34:6 ESV**

### Emet - His character

The Hebrew word translated faithfulness comes from the word 'Emet' meaning trustworthy or truth. God is Emet - God is truth or trustworthy. Emet is quite closely related to Amen which means "That's truth". 

The word Emet can refer to correct ideas or concepts. The word Emet has to do with stability, reliability.

In Exodus 17, the Israelites battle the Amalakites. In the story, Israel won as long as Moses' hands were raised. In verse 12, when Moses raises his hands to defeat the Amalakites, they place rock under his hand so that he stays steady. That word used  to talk about Moses' steady hands is "emet". 

Other usages in scripture include when it is used to refer to trustworthy or reliable people. For eg. We see in Exodus 18:21 - when Moses appoints leaders, they were to be people of "emet". The verse indicates they were people who were trustowrhy and those who would not take bribes. Ps 31:5 describes God as "El Emet". He is the **God of faithfulness!**

> “The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and just is He. - **Deutronomy 32:4 NASB**

### He'emin - Our response to his faithfulness

- Hebrew word for trust is the verb form of Emet translated in English as 'to believe or to have faith' but it's most basic foundational meaning is just to consider someone as trustworthy. Abraham He'emins God. He considers God trustworthy. 

- Exodus 14:31 - Israel He'emins God to go out of Egypt. 

- 1 Kings 3:6 David walked in Emet before God

- 2 Samuel 7:16 God promises a King

- Jesus son of David, son of Abraham. In the lineage of those of He'emin God

- Romans 15: 8 -9 Came on behalf of God's faithfulness

### Faithfulness

Faithfulness comes from the place of God being unshakeable and trustworthy. He is truth and cannot deny himself (2 Tim 2:13).

His words do not return void and not one of his plans can be thwarted, he can do all things (Job 42:2) When he speaks it is finished and done. When God is so big, powerful and can accomplish everything he determines to do, then isn't he trustworthy?

> If we are faithless, he remains faithful— for he cannot deny himself. 
> 
> - **2 Timothy 2:13 ESV**

### Verses to meditate upon

Duet 7:9 Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,

Ex 20:6 But showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.

Num 23:19  God is not man, that he should lie, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it? 

Psa 31:3  For you are my rock and my fortress; and for your name's sake you lead me and guide me; 

Psa 31:5  Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.  -> HIs name is El Emet (God of faithfulness/truth)
