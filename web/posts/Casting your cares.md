# Casting your cares upon him

Worry and anxiety stem from a control issue. When you and I want to control situations, we worry, we are anxious and we try to control outcomes which are beyond our ability. A worrying heart often indicates a controlling spirit, a legalistic-work mentality, an unresting heart and a false belief that your hard work is what caused you to succeed. In summary, it is a lack of trust in God's faithfulness.

Anxiety (Greek: merimnao) comes from the root word merismos in Greek which means divided, distributed or separated. The usages in scripture include the division of property, distribution of gifts to the believers. In summary, anxiety and worry can be defined as a divided mind. A mind that has clutter and no clarity and unity of thought. Faith on the other hand is an unshakable trust in our unshakeable God.

## God loves you beyond measure

AMP The LORD appeared to me (Israel) from ages past, *saying,* “I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you *and* continued My faithfulness to you

Just as a father has compassion on his children so the Lord has compassion on us. As high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love towards us. Unfathomable God (Ps 103: 11-13, 17)

1 Pet 5:7 casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully].

God loves you so much. There is a deep affection and love from his heart. He watches over us so carefully, he adores, he cherishes us and just enjoys watching us. 1 John 4:16 tells us that God is love. If God is love, then child of God, God then is this from 1 Cor 13:

- God endures with patience and serenity

- He is kind and thoughtful and not jealous or envious

- He does not brang and is not proud or arrogant

- He is not rude, self-seeking or not provoked easily

- He does not take into account our wrong doing when dealing with us 

- He does not rejoice at injustice done to us but instead rejoices with the truth (when right and truth prevail)

- He bears all things regardless of what comes, He continually believes in us at all times, He hopes all things, and endures all things

- He never fails. Prophecies may have failed, or tongues might not have worked, your knowledge and all the good stuff may never have worked. But trust God becuse he will never fail and he never can fail.

### You were not responsible for your successes. God is.

Job 40:9 “Have you an arm like God,  and can you thunder with a voice like His?

Job 40:14 “[If you can do all this, Job, proving your divine power] then I [God] will also praise you *and* acknowledge that your own right hand can save you.

### You have no control. But God is sovereign over your life.

You gave your life to Jesus. Yes there's a devil roaming around but now you are God's property and not your own. The devil needs permission even in your life to sift you. God has mighty plans to prosper you. Have faith. Jeremiah 29:11 - There's a hope and future in God's prosperous plans for you.

- Not one of God's plans can be thwarted Job 42:2

- You can't save yourself Job 40:14

- Tell me this: And who of you by worrying can add one hour to [the length of] his life? May 6:27

### Let it go child. Let God correct you tonight.

Read Job 41:1 - 42:6

When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. When you walk through fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn you Isaiah 43:2

Verses to meditate on:

1 Pet 5:7, Job 41-43 (God's response to Job's suffering),
