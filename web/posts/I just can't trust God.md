## The Issues of Trusting

Trusting God can feel like an insurmountable challenge at times. Various factors contribute to this struggle:

- **Deceptive Doctrines**: False teachings can create strongholds of lies that erode trust.
- **Past Trauma**: Previous experiences of pain or betrayal can make it difficult to trust God in similar situations.
- **Misinterpreting God**: Incorrectly understanding or hearing from God in the past can lead to doubt.
- **Failed Words/Prophecies**: Disappointments from unfulfilled promises can breed skepticism.
- **Lack of Understanding**: Not comprehending God's ways can create doubt about His trustworthiness.
- **Unthankful Heart**: Failing to recognize and appreciate God's goodness can undermine trust.

## Outcomes of Distrust

The consequences of struggling to trust God can manifest in various ways:

- **Anxiety**: Divided thoughts and incessant worrying.
- **Depression**: A focus on current struggles without acknowledging God's victories.
- **Fear of Failure**: Expecting negative outcomes and lacking confidence.
- **Over-Reliance on Reasoning**: Depending excessively on human logic over faith in God's providence.

## We're all different

Each person's journey with trust issues is unique, shaped by past traumas and inherent personality traits. Understanding our backgrounds and predispositions can help navigate these challenges effectively. These signifcant events in the past have defined us and have contributed to a certain philosophy in our lives.

## Addressing Neediness

The way we were created also can play a role in how we respond to certain outcomes. For example a sensitive person who has strong emotions is vulnerable to feeling depressed and feeling the weight of pain if he fails to understand God. On the other hand we could argue that we were created that way to be able to harness powerful emotions for the betterment of others instead of responding negatively to outside circumstances.

Seeking security and fulfillment in human relationships often stems from anxiety and fear. Recognizing that ultimate security comes from God can alleviate the neediness we feel towards others.

## God's Trustworthiness - How Faithful is He?

Understanding God's faithfulness is crucial in overcoming our issues of trusting Him:

- **Divine Promise**: God's covenant with His people spans generations, rooted in steadfast love.

> Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments. - **Deuteronomy 7:9 NIV**

- **Defined Character**: The Lord is merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in steadfast love and faithfulness.

> The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, - **Exodus 34:6 ESV**

- **Unshakeable God**: His trustworthiness stems from His unchanging nature; His words never return void, and His plans cannot be thwarted.

> “I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted. - **Job 42:2 ESV**

- **Undeniable Nature**: Even in our faithlessness, God remains faithful; His reliability is unwavering. He is truth and cannot deny himself.

> if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself. - **2 Timothy 2:13 NIV**

### Surrendering Control

Recognizing God's sovereignty over our lives is liberating:

- **Property of God**: As believers, we belong to God; casting anxieties on Him is an act of trust and surrender.
- **Divine Care**: Knowing that God deeply cares for us enables us to release our burdens to Him.

> casting all your cares [all your anxieties, all your worries, and all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares about you [with deepest affection, and watches over you very carefully]. - **1 Peter 5:7 AMP**

## Proclamation

Trusting God is a journey, but understanding His unwavering faithfulness and relinquishing control are foundational steps. Despite our struggles, God remains faithful, offering comfort, security, and hope in every circumstance.
Make this your proclamation today (Based on 1 Corinthians 6:20 and 2 peter 5:7 AMP):

> The Lord is sovereign over me because it is no longer I who live but Jesus who lives in me. I am not my own and I am a property of Almighty God. I can now cast my anxieties on him for he cares for me deeply and affectionately.
