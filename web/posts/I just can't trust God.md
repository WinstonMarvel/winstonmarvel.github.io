# I just can't trust God

## Trust Issues

Trusting God can be one of the hardest things to do. What can be the root causes:

- Deceptive doctrines (Strongholds of lies)

- Past trauma (How do I trust God in this area again?)

- Incorrectly hearing God in the past

- Failed words/prophecies

- Lack of understanding of God's ways

- Is he really trustworthy?

- Unthankful heart

## Outcomes

- Anxiety (Divided thoughts)

- Depression (Continous attention on the current situation and failure to recognize God's victory in a situation)

- Fear of failure (Confident hope of negative end)

- Relying on the thought realm (Being overly pragmatic and leaving less room for God's primary way of operating - Faith)

## We're all different

Each of us have had varied past experiences/traumas. These signifcant events in the past have defined us and created a certain philosophy in our lives (belief pattern).

The way we were created also can play a role in how we respond to certain outcomes. For example a sensitive person who has strong emotions is vulnerable to feeling depressed and feeling the weight of pain if he fails to understand God. On the other hand he was created that way to be able to harness him emotions in a better way instead of responding to outside circumstances.

## Neediness

Being needy to a partner or friend is often a result of a root underlying cause - Anxiety and fear. We are needy because we are searching for something in other people, a sense of security. Ultimately only God can provide a sense of security. We will stop being needy once we recognize that God is the one who provides

## How trustworthy (Faithful) he is

Duet 7:9 Know therefore that the LORD your God is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, to a thousand generations,

Ex 20:6 But showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.

Definition of God

Ex 34:6 The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, -> The word faithfulness comes from the root word meaning truth. God is truth.

Faithfulness comes from the place of God being unshakeable and trustworthy. He is truth and cannot deny himself (2 Tim 2:13). His words do not return void and not one of his plans can be thwarted, he can do all things (Job 42:2) When he speaks it is finished and done. When God is so big, powerful and can accomplish everything he determines to do, then isn't he trustworthy?

Proverbs 3:3-4

Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.

2 Timothy 2:13

If we are faithless, he remains faithful— for he cannot deny himself.

### Who's in control of our lives?

The Lord is sovereign over ME because it is no longer us who lives but Jesus who lives in us. I am not my own and I am a property of Almighty God. 1cor 6:20. I can now cast my anxieties on him for he cares for me deeply and affectionately (AMP 2 peter 5:7)

Job 41-43
