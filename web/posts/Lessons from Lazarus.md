## Lessons from the resurrection of Lazurus

John 11 is an interesting passage that we can learn a few lessons from.

Things to note:

- Lazarus was a disciple because the way sisters introduced him was that Jesus loved him (John 11:1)

- Lazarus was probably a disciple because of the way he was introduced to Jesus by his sisters. "The one whom you love" v1 and also Martha saying that he will rise in the last day v24. Jesus also while Lazarus was the subject of discussion referenced the resurrection of the dead for those who believed in him v25
  
  - Why is it relevant the Lazarus was a disciple? Because Jesus didn't have to raise Lazarus. Think about v25. Lazarus was in a better place. He could have encouraged them that Lazarus would live forever in heaven and he is happy, yada yada. For the sake of them whom he loves so much, he raised Lazarus from the dead.

- Jesus deliberately stayed back for 2 days. But why? The reason is unclear but we know that he also was glad that he wasn't there. Jesus was indicating that if he was there, Lazarus would not have died.
  
  > And for your sake, I’m glad I wasn’t there, because now you have another opportunity to see who I am so that you will learn to trust in me. Come, let’s go and see him.” - John 11:15 TPT

- Jesus probably didn't move yet because of a timing issue. He always did what he saw the Father do. 

- We could also argue that Jesus did not "deliberately" delay because his heart was so moved when he saw the sisters that he wept. The scripture does not tell us why he waited 2 days before he saw the Father's heart to move. But we do know that Jesus did only what he saw the Father do. Perhaps he never questioned the Father why 2 days but he trusted in the infinite wisdom of God. Going immediately could have caused other problems with Jews too.
  
  v9,v10 are confusing but could indicate that he did not stay back because of fear. Walking at night may seem safer but has fear as a motivation while walking in the day is walking in the power and presence of the light. God was with him and v9 and v10 could indicate that this was the right time for Jesus to move.
  
  > Jesus replied, “There are twelve hours of daylight every day. During the day people can walk safely. They can see because they have the light of this world. 10 But at night there is danger of stumbling because they have no light.” - John 11:9,10 NLT
  
  It's interesting how God accomplished the purposes of avoiding trouble with Jews while also still resurrecting Lazarus from the dead.

- John 11:33 says a deep anger welled up in him and he was deeply troubled. The pain that he saw on the face of Martha, Mary and the people angered his spirit and deeply troubled him. Think of that for a moment. Let it sink in. Your pain and your problems deeply anger the heart of God and move him so much. God is angry at the attacks of the enemy over us. The amplified Bible uses this phrase ot explain the emotion that Jesus felt: "deeply moved in spirit [to the point of anger at the sorrow caused by death]"

### Jesus did not have to raise Lazarus from the dead

### Their pain deeply moved his heart

### An infinite God who works miracles even in this finite world

### God loves you beyond measure

God is your father. The Bible tells us that just as a father has compassion on his children so the Lord has compassion on us. As high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love towards us. (Ps 103: 11-13, 17)

> The LORD appeared to me (Israel) from ages past, *saying,* “I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore with lovingkindness, I have drawn you *and* continued My faithfulness to you - **Jeremiah 31:3 AMP
