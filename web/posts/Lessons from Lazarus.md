John 11 is quite an interesting passage that we can learn a few lessons from. As I studied these passages, a few things stood out to me. Here are three lessons from this passage that are interesting:

## 1. Jesus did not have to raise Lazarus from the dead

For context, Lazarus was a disciple because of the way the sisters introduced him to Jesus. Notice the words used to introduce him: "the one whom Jesus loved" (John 11:1). Martha mentions that Lazarus will rise at the resurrection at the last day (v24). As you read the passage, we get a sense of Lazarus being spoken of as a follower of Jesus who would "rise at the last day". In verse 25, While Jesus even referenced the resurrection of the dead for those who believed in him (v25) indicating Lazarus was destined to rise from the dead. These are strong arguments for the fact that Lazarus was a disciple of Jesus.

So why is it relevant that Lazarus was a disciple? **The truth is that if Lazarus was a believer, Jesus didn't have to raise Lazarus from the dead. Lazarus would rise from the dead anyway.** Think about it carefully. Lazarus was supposedly in a better place. Jesus could have simply encouraged them that Lazarus would live for eternity in heaven and that he was in a much  happier place. For the sake of them whom he loved so deeply, Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. **That says a lot about the heart of the Father! He would rather raise Lazarus from the dead for the sake of the hurt family.**

## 2. Their pain deeply moved Jesus' heart

John 11:33 outrightly tells us that a deep anger welled up in Jesus and he was **deeply troubled**. It paints a picture that the pain that he saw on the face of Martha, Mary and the people angered his spirit and deeply troubled him. Let's pause for a moment. Let it sink in. ***Your pain and your problems deeply anger the heart of God and move him so much.*** God is angry at the attacks of the enemy over us. 

The amplified Bible uses this phrase to explain the emotions that Jesus felt: "deeply moved in spirit [to the point of anger at the sorrow caused by death]"

> 33 When Jesus saw her sobbing, and the Jews who had come with her also sobbing, He was deeply moved in spirit [to the point of anger at the sorrow caused by death] and was troubled, - **John 11:33 AMP**

God is our good father. The Bible tells us that just as a father has compassion on his children so the Lord has compassion on us. As high as the heavens are above the earth so great is his love towards us. (Ps 103: 11-13, 17)

The heart of the father is so full of love that our pain affects his heart.

> The LORD appeared to me (Israel) from ages past, *saying,* “I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore with lovingkindness, I have drawn you *and* continued My faithfulness to you - **Jeremiah 31:3 AMP**

## 3. An infinite God who works miracles even in this finite world

When Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, he deliberately stayed back for 2 days. This is confusing. Why does Jesus stay back? Scripture does not give us a clear reason but we do know that he was glad that he wasn't there.

> And for your sake, I’m glad I wasn’t there, because now you have another opportunity to see who I am so that you will learn to trust in me. Come, let’s go and see him.” - **John 11:15 TPT**

Jesus was indicating that if he was there earlier, Lazarus would **NOT** have died. 

As to why he didn't go earlier, Jesus probably didn't move yet because of a timing issue. He always did what he saw the Father do.

We could also argue that Jesus did not "deliberately" delay because his heart was so moved when he saw the sisters, that he himself wept. The scripture does not tell us why he waited 2 days before he saw the Father's heart to move, but we do know that Jesus did only what he saw the Father do. Perhaps he never questioned the Father about the delay but he trusted in the infinite wisdom of God. This was his obedience to God's timing, something beautiful that we can learn from His life.

It is quite possible that if Jesus went immediately, it could have caused other problems with Jews too. We cannot say for sure. **God accomplished the purposes of avoiding trouble with Jews while also still resurrecting Lazarus from the dead.** 

Does this not say something about your problems? ***The circumstances may be very limiting but God can do the impossible even amdist the finite limitiations of your situation.***

## Action items

- *Remind yourself, "God knows". He knows your heart, he knows the troubles you face and he knows the mountains you cannot climb. He sits right beside you as you weep. Trust God today that he will come through. He may be 4 days late, but he will restore to you everything that the devil has stolen.*

> I will restore to you the years  
>     that the swarming locust has eaten, - **Joel 2:25a ESV**
